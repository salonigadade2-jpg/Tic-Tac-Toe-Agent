# Tic-Tac-Toe AI 🎮🤖

## Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI Agent

This project implements an **AI agent** that plays the classic game of **Tic-Tac-Toe** against a human player. The AI uses game-theory-based algorithms such as **Minimax**, with optional **Alpha-Beta Pruning**, to make optimal decisions and remain unbeatable.

The project provides a hands-on understanding of decision-making algorithms and adversarial search techniques.

## 🔹 Project Description

The Tic-Tac-Toe AI evaluates all possible game states and chooses the best possible move to either win or force a draw. By applying the **Minimax algorithm**, the AI assumes the opponent always plays optimally.


## 🔹 Features

- Human vs AI gameplay  
- Unbeatable AI using Minimax algorithm  
- Optional Alpha-Beta Pruning for optimization  
- Clear win/draw detection  
- Console-based user interaction  
- Beginner-friendly and well-structured logic  


## 🔹 Technologies Used

- Programming Language: **Python**  

## 🔹 How It Works

1. The board state is represented using a matrix or list
2. Human player makes a move
3. AI evaluates all possible future states using Minimax
4. The best move is selected based on maximum score
5. Game continues until win, lose, or draw

## 🔹 Example Gameplay

```text
Player (X): Choose position (1–9)
AI (O): Making move...

X | O | X
---------
O | X | O
---------
O | X | X

Result: Draw
